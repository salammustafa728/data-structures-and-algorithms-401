# Stacks and Queues


stack and queue is a data strurcture data container and it more efficient to store values in large project



## Challenge

Create a node
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated and
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

## Approach & Efficiency

The Big O(1) for the peek and is empty
and the 0(1) for push and pop and enqueue and dequeue because I don't use the iteration

## API


**Stack methods:**

* push: adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack 

* pop: Removes the node from the top of the stack

* peek: Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack

* isEmpty: Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

**Queue**

* enqueue: adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue 

* dequeue: Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue, removes the node from the front of the queue and should raise exception when called on empty queue.

* peek: Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack

* isEmpty: Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
